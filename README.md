# Python-Project
**Project Overview**
This project analyzes social media usage patterns among students to understand their impact on mental health, sleep, academic performance, and addiction risk levels.
Using Python data analysis and visualization techniques, the project converts raw survey data into meaningful insights and actionable recommendations.

The analysis focuses on identifying high-risk students, behavioral trends across age, gender, academic level, and country, and proposing detox strategies based on risk classification.

**Dataset Description**

Records: 705 students
Features: 13 original columns (demographics, usage behavior, mental health indicators)

**Tools & Libraries Used**

Python
Pandas – Data cleaning & transformation
NumPy – Numerical operations
Matplotlib – Data visualization
Seaborn – Advanced visualizations

**Project Workflow**

1️⃣ Data Understanding & Cleaning

2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Descriptive statistics for key numerical features
Distribution analysis by:
Age
Gender
Academic Level
Usage behavior comparison across demographics
Country-wise addiction and usage trends

3️⃣ Feature Engineering

Risk Level Classification (Low / Medium / High) based on daily usage
Performance Impact Flag based on academic performance
Detox Strategy Recommendation based on:
Usage hours
Sleep duration
Risk category

4️⃣ Data Visualization
Visualizations created to support insights:
Line charts for platform-wise usage
Bar charts and pie charts for gender and age distribution
Box plots for addiction score and usage patterns
Scatter plots for mental health vs addiction
Heatmap for correlation analysis
Country-wise high-risk student analysis

**Key Insights**

Students with higher daily usage hours show:
Lower sleep duration
Higher addiction scores
Poorer mental health
High school and undergraduate students are at higher risk
Females show slightly higher average daily usage
High addiction scores strongly correlate with:
Academic performance impact
Increased social conflicts
Most students fall into Medium Risk, followed by High Risk

**Risk-Level Based Detox Strategy**
High Risk:
Social media breaks
Sleep improvement
Gradual usage reduction

Medium Risk:
Screen-time control
Offline activity encouragement
Awareness programs

Low Risk:
Maintain healthy habits

**Recommendations**

Early identification of high-risk students
Institutional awareness programs on social media addiction
Parental and educator involvement
Encourage offline social and physical activities
Promote digital well-being education

Conclusion

This project demonstrates the ability to:

Clean and analyze real-world datasets
Apply statistical and exploratory techniques
Build meaningful visualizations
Translate data insights into practical recommendations
It showcases end-to-end data analytics skills suitable for Data Analyst / Business Analyst roles.
